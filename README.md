# Xrome
Enables to open your chrome for mac in incognito, without opening and closing non-incognito window.

#Features

1. When chrome is NOT running
Starts running chrome, and open an incognito window (the non-incognito window you usually see will NOT open).

2. When chrome is running
Opens a new incognito window. Other windows will be kept open.

#How to use it

1. Download the ZIP by clicking "Download ZIP."
2. Extract it.
3. Open the app, or open the script("xrome.scpt") on applescript and save it as an app.
4. I recommend you to add it on the dock so that you can run it easily.
5. Say goodbye to all those annoying non-incognito, and have fun! :)
